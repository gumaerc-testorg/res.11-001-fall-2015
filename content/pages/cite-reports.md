Solar Lanterns
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In summer 2013, CITE conducted its first-ever product evaluation in Western Uganda. Researchers conducted hundreds of surveys with consumers, suppliers, manufacturers, and nonprofits to evaluate 11 locally available solar lantern models. The team assessed solar lanterns from three integrated perspectives: Suitability (does a product perform its intended purpose), scalability (can the supply chain effectively reach consumers), and sustainability (is the product used correctly, consistently, and continuously over time). This evaluation report includes a _Consumer Reports_\-style Solar Lantern Comparative Rating Chart, an in-depth supply chain analysis, and an in-depth analysis of Solar Sister, a regional nonprofit organization and key player in Uganda's solar lantern market.

Water Filters
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
CITE's household water filter evaluation studied innovations with the potential to better the lives of India's "water poor"—the 76 million people in the country who lack improved drinking water. CITE teams studied over 100 models of householder water filters from nine major brands available on the market in Ahmedabad, India. These models fell into three main categories: conventional particle filtration (cloth / _jali_ mesh), gravity non-electric filters, and reverse osmosis filters. CITE used multi-criteria analysis and _Consumer Reports_\-style rating charts to guide its water filter evaluation report, which was released in October 2015.

Water Test Kits
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Without access to reliable, low-cost water testing labs, many development organizations and governments have turned to portable water test kits as a stopgap solution for testing community water quality. CITE’s latest report, “Streamlining a Methodology for Product Evaluation: Water Test Kits in India,” details the study design and findings of a product evaluation conducted in Ahmedabad, India on two types of water testing kits: single parameter, and multi-parameter.

Educational Technologies Evaluation
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This report describes a new decision-making tool for teachers, administrators, governments, global development practitioners, and other stakeholders trying to make smart decisions about incorporating technology in the classroom. The framework seeks to help stakeholders explore how well a particular technology may fit their educational context by posing straight-forward questions such as: “Does the technology create a burden of extra management for the teacher?” and “Is there evidence that use of this technology aids learning? Is this evidence generalizable to your context?” Questions fall into eight categories: teachers; students; culture; sustainability; community, social, and political; learning; infrastructure; and scalability and market impact.
